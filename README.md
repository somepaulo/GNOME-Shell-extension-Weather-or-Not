A simple extension for GNOME Shell 45+ (versions 42 to 44 supported in separate [branch](https://github.com/somepaulo/GNOME-Shell-extension-Weather-or-Not/tree/42-44)) that adds an icon showing the current weather conditions and temperature to the panel. The indicator position can be adjusted in preferences (on GNOMEÂ 45+ only). Clicking the icon opens GNOME Weather.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need GNOME Weather installed for this extension to function properly and an active internet connection to retrieve and display weather information.
> The temperature unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) is obtained directly from the system's regional preferences.
